First Project
In this project you will find the principals events that made Argentina become a free country.
I have decided for this topic because I am from Argentina and I wanted to make an easy to read resume of Argentina history from 1810 to 1862.
My goal for this web page is that a person who have never heard about the country and want to know how was the timeline facts, political and territory developing could do it.
The project is divided in four HTML files where each shows the context, the May Revolution, Independence War and Civil War.
Each file have a description of the events with information in tables and images to get the reader interested in the content.
